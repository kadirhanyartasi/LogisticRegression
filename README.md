Introduction

In today's healthcare sector, the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes are becoming increasingly important. 
In this analysis, a study has been conducted on various factors influencing diabetes and how these factors can be used to predict an individual's risk of diabetes.

Data Collection and Description

The dataset used in the analysis is a dataset containing potential indicators of diabetes. 
The dataset includes features such as number of pregnancies , glucose level , blood pressure , skin thickness , insulin level , body mass index, diabetes pedigree function , age , and Outcome.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Firstly, the structural analysis of the dataset was conducted, and the presence of missing or abnormal values was checked. 
Then, the distribution of data, measures of central tendency, and relationships between variables were examined using visualization techniques.
Particularly, distributions of characteristics related to diabetic patients and comparisons with healthy individuals were visualized.

Data Preprocessing and Modeling

During the data preprocessing stage, missing or abnormal values were handled using appropriate methods. 
Subsequently, the dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. In the model creation stage, logistic regression method was preferred.
This method was used to analyze the relationship between the dependent variable (Outcome) and other independent variables.

Results and Discussion

The logistic regression model has shown to be an appropriate approach for predicting the risk of diabetes based on the variables in the dataset. 
The performance of the model was evaluated using various evaluation metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). 
The results have shown that factors such as glucose level, body mass index, and age play an important role in determining the risk of diabetes.
